# AmazonPriceTracker
A program to track the price of products and notify the user if it goes down

## This program works only for GMAIL accounts

For this program to work the following steps must be followed
1- There is a details.json file in which you have to add your GMAIL and the APP PASSWORD
2-In the main program ther is a recipient email, you have to assign a GMAIL of the person you will send the email to you can send yourself the email
  by assigning recipient email as any other gmail account you have 

3-There is a procedure to generate your own app password in GMAIL I found this youtube link to help with that https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5V_FiEHS0c8
4- In my_dict.json you have to paste url of any product you want to buy and set the target price at which you want to buy the product

Furthermore, we can also upload the project on plateforms like pythonAnywhere so that it can run automatically on a scheduled time
